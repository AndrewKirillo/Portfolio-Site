Hey there!
I'm currently a sophomore in UC Berkeley's Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology (M.E.T.) program, pursuing a dual degree in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science and Business Administration.
My goal in life is to create products that empower others to fulfill their ambitions.
At the moment, my technical interests lie in distributed systems, full-stack engineering, and product management.
I am also interested in tech entrepreneurship, and am an avid boxer in my free time!
