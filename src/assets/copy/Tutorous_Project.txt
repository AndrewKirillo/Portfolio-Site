Created an online tutoring platform, Tutorous, to provide accessible tutoring to disadvantaged populations, geared towards high-school tutors.
Tutorous featured video conferencing, instant messaging, and real-time collaborative document viewing and annotation.
This was a full-stack application built with Angular and Node, served from Microsoft Azure.

Partnered with local schools and NGO Paper Airplanes to get Tutorous in the hands of students and Syrian refugees, to empower their pursuit of higher education.
