Architected a video content management system (CMS) and discovery platform for Zoom Webinars with an integrated social network made up of brand-able channels, including 3rd party marketing integrations and a video analytics suite.
This was a prototype for a new product offering that was pitched to the CEO, Eric Yuan, and now a limited set of the proposed features is being experimented with on the Zoom website.
Built using a Node backend communicating with the Zoom Webinar API, AWS DynamoDB, and AWS S3; linked to a React frontend, hosted on AWS EC2.

Developed 2 of the first 100 apps for the Zoom App Marketplace, each of which were chatbot-based integrations for 3rd-party SaaS products.
These were created using a Node backend that utilized AWS DynamoDB and the Zoom Chat API to trigger 3rd-party API actions. Each bot also included a React configuration page, and was hosted on AWS Lambda.

Deliberated with product specialists from our integration partners, such as Qualtrics, to hash out appropriate use cases, feature sets, and product roadmaps.
